# QuieTrack
QuieTrack is my IoT-based noise monitoring system school project. It uses an ESP32 to track noise levels in real-time and pushes that data to a React-based web dashboard via Firebase. Perfect for monitoring quiet zones (like libraries or study rooms) without having to manually check.

## Components
- ESP32 WROOM DA Microcontroller
- Crowtail Sound Sensor 2.0 (LMV358)
- OLED LCD 1306
